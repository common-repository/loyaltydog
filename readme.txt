LoyaltyDog - Increase revenue with the leading digital mobile loyalty program for on-premise and online stores. Engage with your customers everywhere.

== Description ==

### LoyaltyDog - Best Loyalty Program Plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce ###

LoyaltyDog is the premier loyalty platform that provides you with outstanding and robust **digital mobile engagement**. What makes LoyaltyDog different from other loyalty apps is that your loyalty program is completely your own program. You control all aspects of the program and your competitors are not "on an app" that you are telling your customers to download. With LoyaltyDog, your program is 100% yours.

NOTE: A LoyaltyDog subscription (Woocommerce "add-on" or "standalone" level) is required. Subscriptions are available at https://loyalty.dog

**LoyaltyDog's feature list includes:**

* A digital loyalty card that is stored in the smartphone's digital wallet
* Full flexible program that supports Stampcards or Multi-Tier Point systems
* Customer referral scheme that provides real incentives for your customers to bring their friends
* Full profile & activity history of each customer
* Rewards system that includes scheduled and multi-tiered rewards with restrictions
* Push notifications to your customer base that you control
* Locality - your customers are notified in their lock-screen if they are closeby
* Beacon support for increased engagement on-premise including cross-selling and up-selling
* Multilocation support - tie your locations together under a single account
* Ecommerce support - if you sell online as well as at your location
